# Parameters for IIM dipole model
# 
# Parameters are taken from an article by Cyrille Marquet
# see arXiv: hep-ph/0706.2682v1
#
# Syntax of this file is the following:
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Parameters are given as a pair key:value
# Values are in units of GeV^n and possible keys are:
# alpha, beta, x_0, N_0, kappa, lambda, gammac, B_D


# Saturation scale Q_s:
x_0:0.00001632
lambda:0.2197

# Dipole amplitude
N_0:0.7
kappa:9.9
gammac:0.7376

# Impact parameter dependence
# Note: B_D=4 is suggested by Kowalski (arXiv: hep-ph/0909.1254v1), and
# B_D=5.591 is suggested by Marquet. Ip Non-Sat and IP Sat models use B_D=4
# Unit: GeV^(-2)
#B_D:4.0
B_D:5.591

# alpha and beta are defined so that the amplitude and its derivative are 
# continuous
alpha:0.615065
beta:1.00642
