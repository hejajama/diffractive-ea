Numerical code to calculate differential cross section d\sigma/dt for
diffractive electron nucleus scattering

Author: Heikki MÃ¤ntysaari <heikki.mantysaari@jyu.fi>

About the code:
- Idea is that it should be easy to plug in different models for dipole-proton
  scattering amplitude (e.g. IPSat, IPNonSat and IIM), gluon distribution etc.
  To obtain this some virtual classes are used, for dipole-nucleus cross 
  section all classes has to be derived from Dipxs class etc. 
  Read the code in main.cpp, it should be quite clear how does it work.
- Numerical calculations are done using GSL library
- Program supports parallerization using OpenMP. Compile with -fopenmp and
  start by typing
   OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./dipole
    * There are still some probles with parallerization and gsl integrals...
  
This program prints results in stdout, so you propably want to use pipes:
 ./dipole -N 10000 > my_result.dat

Error messages are printed to stderr.

Thanks:
 Some parts of this code is originally written by Tuomas Lappi and I have made
 only minor changes to those parts. At the beginning of each file it is 
 mentoned if the code is written by Lappi or someone else other than the 
 author.
